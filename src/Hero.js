        I took a practice template from a normal website made using Bootstrap Framework, and simplifed in to various components as much as I could. Please have a look on to this and give me a feedback regarding it.
        React is very scalable and easy to use.

Yes, React is Awesome
        isn't it?
      </p>
      <a className="btn btn-success btn-lg" href="#" role="button"
